This is the third installment of a four-part blog post on a fall trip to the White Mountains. Check out [Part 1](https://www.codyhou.com/fall-white-mountains-1/) and [Part 2](https://www.codyhou.com/fall-white-mountains-2/) if you haven't yet.

## Flume Gorge

Our first stop was the [Flume Gorge](https://www.nhstateparks.org/visit/state-parks/flume-gorge). The first thought that crossed my mind was how many people there were in the park despite it being 9:00 on a Friday morningâ€”there was already a line at the entrance! I later heard from a friend who visited that Saturday around 10:00 AM that they turned down visitors without reservations, so make sure to get one from their official website at least the day before. (You also save $3!)

Flume Gorge, along with the previously documented viewpoints on the Kancamagus Highway, is a much more accessible destination for leaf peeping due to the park's gravel trails and boardwalks. The trail passes by the vibrant red [Flume Covered Bridge](https://www.nh.gov/nhdhr/bridges/p75.html), one of many in the region, before delving into the namesake gorge. It's actually a fantastic location to photograph long exposures with fall foliage, though since the boardwalks are fairly narrow, doing so might end up causing a traffic jam...

The trail then begins to loop around, but not before passing over a gorge carved by the Pemigewasset River (which the Flume Brook feeds). [Sentinel Pine Covered Bridge](https://www.nh.gov/nhdhr/bridges/p73.html) offers good views of the gorge below. The most impressive views of the bridge can be accessed from a marked trail on the left just after crossing the bridge.

Overall the visit was certainly worth the crowds and $18 entrance fee; just make sure you're happy with your pictures before leaving :smiley:

## Crawford Notch State Park

We then headed over to the Crawford Notch, as driving through it the previous day had made us curious about the views in this area. A fortuitous pit stop (not words I normally use together) at the [Willey House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willey_House_(New_Hampshire)) lead us across the street to the Willey Pond. The grandiose mountains and its fall foliage reflected perfectly on the water. I spent a good hour or two admiring and photographing the reflections and even stayed through a brief rain shower.

On a clear day I can imagine this area being the perfect place for a picnic.

Backtracking slightly, there are several more viewpoints also worth checking out. The [Crawford Notch Scenic Parking Area](https://goo.gl/maps/LZhd8FxL1hicXzWi9) is an easy way to look over the pass (see the header photo). You can also park at the [Crawford Notch Depot](https://goo.gl/maps/f6EdkVCAd5Dm2wtV6) to get reflections on Saco Lake or adventure on the railroad tracks (when the trains aren't running!). I wasn't enough of a daredevil to go on the tracks in case there was another train, but I hear you can get a shot of the train on the [Willey Brook Trestle](https://bridgehunter.com/nh/carroll/cwsr---willey-brook/) if you are adventurous.

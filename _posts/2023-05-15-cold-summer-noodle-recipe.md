This quick and easy recipe is perfect for combatting hot summer temperatures. Variations of this cold noodle ("liang mian," 凉面) recipe exist on the internet, but I prefer this one made by my mom.

## Ingredients

* 1 package angel hair noodles
* 1.5-2 tbsp Korean chili flakes (gochugaru)
* 1.5-2 tbsp Sichuan peppercorn powder ("hua jiao fen," 花椒粉); ingredient on package may be labeled as "prickly ash"
* 3-4 medium cloves finely minced garlic
* 4 tbsp Zhenjiang vinegar (also spelled as Chinkiang vinegar); I use [this one](https://www.amazon.com/%E9%95%87%E6%B1%9F%E9%A6%99%E9%86%8B-Chinkiang-Zhen-Jiang-Vinegar/dp/B07BXK1WT3). I have substituted with 3-4 tbsp Chinese rice vinegar with good results. If using unseasoned Japanese rice vinegar, you may need to add an additional tablespoon.
* 4 tbsp soy sauce
* 1 tbsp sesame oil
* Olive oil
* Sugar
* Salt
* Mini cucumbers
* Honey ham

## Recipe

Boil angel hair noodles until soft (I used the upper end of the time range written on the package). Immediately rinse noodles with cold water until no longer hot, and drain as much water as possible. Liberally mix olive oil (3-4 tbsp or more) with noodles to prevent them from sticking.

In a heat-resistant bowl, add Korean chili flakes, Sichuan peppercorn powder, and minced garlic. Heat a third of a cup (~80 mL) of olive oil until hot, and then slowly pour the hot oil evenly over the spice and garlic mixture to cook them.

Add the spiced oil/garlic mixture, vinegar, soy sauce, and sesame oil to the noodles and mix thoroughly. Add half a tablespoon of salt and sugar to taste. 

Noodles can be eaten chilled, at room temperature, or slightly warmed in the microwave. Serve noodles with julienned mini cucumber and sliced honey ham. An easy matching side dish is sliced vine-ripe tomato dusted with sugar on top.

For better or worse I got myself into a new hobby: electric guitar!

I had actually considered classical guitar for some time as I really liked pieces by Vivaldi and TÃ¡rrega, but after realizing that a lot of the plucking techniques seem to employ long fingernails, that idea was quickly thrown out. A combination of watching [Bocchi the Rock!](https://myanimelist.net/anime/47917/Bocchi_the_Rock), hearing guitar covers of songs I like on YouTube (such as [Unmei no Hito](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_s_0_5N43Q), [future gazer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3kbIr_h8Xo), and [Minato](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKpE2U0kxMc)), and my itching whim to do something new in the last months of my gap year led me to start electric guitar.

Initially I was considering the [Yamaha PAC112V](https://usa.yamaha.com/products/musical_instruments/guitars_basses/el_guitars/pacifica/pac_100.html) and [Ibanez AZES40](https://www.ibanez.com/usa/products/detail/azes40_1p_01.html) as intro guitars, but after scouring Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace I found a gorgeous like-new Yamaha PAC612VIIX in teal green metallic finish. The seller was out of the country so I had to wait a month before purchasing it, but for $475 I got a higher quality guitar and perfectly matching Yamaha gig bag (Yamaha EG-SC) that would have costed me almost the same as buying a new PAC112V or AZES40 and gig bag online.

For the amp I purchased a four-month-old [Yamaha THR10II](https://usa.yamaha.com/products/musical_instruments/guitars_basses/amps_accessories/thr-ii/index.html) that also looked brand new for $225. I didn't really care for the wireless features of the upper models (and I couldn't find them used in the Boston area anyway). Admittedly the speakers pale in comparison to the [Pioneer SP-BS22-LR](https://www.pioneerhomeusa.com/product/sp-bs22-lr/) in my home theater setup, but it works great as a beginner practice amp.

I also purchased some accessories. Instead of paying $60 for a guitar setup, I wanted to learn how to do it myself, so I also bought guitar maintenance items.

* Strings: [Ernie Ball Regular Slinky 10-46](https://www.ernieball.com/guitar-strings/electric-guitar-strings/slinky-nickel-wound-electric-guitar-strings/6-string#P02221)
* Picks: Dunlop [Nylon 0.38mm](https://www.jimdunlop.com/nylon-standard-pick-38mm/) and [Tortex 0.60mm](https://www.jimdunlop.com/tortex-standard-pick-60mm/)
* Guitar Strap/Strap Lock: [Ernie Ball PolyPro](https://www.ernieball.com/guitar-accessories/guitar-straps/polypro-guitar-straps#P04037) and [Fender Strap Blocks](https://www.fender.com/en-US/parts/strap-locks-buttons/fender-strap-blocks/0990819000.html)
* Cable: [Ernie Ball Braided 10ft](https://www.ernieball.com/guitar-accessories/instrument-cables/braided-cables#P06081)
* Tuner: [TC Electronics Polytune Clip](https://www.tcelectronic.com/product.html?modelCode=P0DFU)
* Guitar Maintenance:
    * [MusicNomad FRINE Fret Polishing Kit](https://www.musicnomadcare.com/Products/FRINE-Fret-Polishing-Kit/): for cleaning/polishing frets
    * [Dunlop System 65 Guitar Tech Kit](https://www.jimdunlop.com/44616504001-formula-65-care-products/): lemon oil to apply to fretboard and string conditioner to extend string life; also comes with string winder and two cloths. The polish contains silicone unfortunately.
    * [MusicNomad Truss Rod Gauge](https://www.musicnomadcare.com/Products/Truss-Rod-Gauge): for adjusting truss rod relief
    * [D'Addario String Height Gauge](https://www.daddario.com/products/accessories/care-maintenance-tools/restring-tools/string-height-gauge/): for adjusting string action, pickup height; also has useful hex tool

Setting up the guitar took a lot more work than I thought it would...but now I know how to adjust the guitar to my liking, especially as the seasons change. I am still having trouble with intonating the low E string, but luckily most chords and pieces I've encountered don't really use that string very much.

I've actually already practiced for several days now using [JustinGuitar.com](https://justinguitar.com/), a fantastic free guitar course. As expected my fingers are hurting, but I can hear and see myself improve! I have played cello before, so some things like rhythm and fingering come more naturally than if guitar were my first musical instrument.

Hi! I'm Cody, a medical student at the University of Minnesota. In my free time I enjoy landscape photography, Japanese variety shows, and messing around with computers. My current fixes are:

* 📝 Blogging with GitHub Pages
* ⌨️  Custom mechanical keyboards
* 🎮 Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Tetris Effect, modded Skyrim
* 🛠️ Fixing and repairing old video game consoles (Nintendo Game Boy and DS Lite)

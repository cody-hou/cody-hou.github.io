Hi! I'm Cody, a first-year resident physician. In my free time I enjoy landscape photography, Japanese variety shows, and messing around with computers. My current fixes are:

* 📝 Blogging with GitHub Pages
* ⌨️  Custom mechanical keyboards
* 🎮 Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Tetris Effect, modded Skyrim
* 🛠️ Fixing and repairing old video game consoles (Nintendo Game Boy and DS Lite)
* 📷 Film photography (35mm and 6x6 medium format) and vintage lense/camera repair

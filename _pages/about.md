Hi! I'm Cody, a third year medical student at the University of Minnesota. In my free time I enjoy landscape photography, road cycling, Japanese variety shows, and messing around with computers. My current fixes are:

* 📝 Blogging with GitHub Pages
* ⛩️ Watching anime (recent favorites: Hyouka, Spice and Wolf, Hibike! Euphonium)
* ⌨️  Custom mechanical keyboards
* 🎮 Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Tetris Effect
* 📚 Reading e-books in Japanese (recently finished 本好きの下剋上～司書になるためには手段を選んでいられません～第一部「兵士の娘I」)
* 🆕🎸 Practicing electric guitar

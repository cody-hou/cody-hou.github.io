Hi! I'm Cody, a second year medical student at the University of Minnesota. I'm currently taking a gap year to conduct research as a Sarnoff Fellow at the Broad Institute. The specialty I'm most interested in is internal medicine and specifically subspecializing in cardiology, but I'm keeping my options open as I haven't done any rotations yet.

In my free time I enjoy landscape photography, road cycling, Japanese variety shows, and messing around with computers. My current fixes are:

* 🥾 Hiking New England as much as I can to see all the good views
* 📝 Blogging with Jekyll and GitHub Pages
* 💻 Mastering and customizing Vim
* 🆕🎮 Stardew Valley
* 🆕⛩️ Rewatching anime
* 🆕⌨️ Custom mechanical keyboards (just bought a bunch of parts and will post when I get it built!)

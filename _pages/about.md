Hi! I'm Cody, a second year medical student at the University of Minnesota. I'm currently on a gap year conducting research as a Sarnoff Fellow at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. 

In my free time I enjoy landscape photography, road cycling, Japanese variety shows, and messing around with computers. My current fixes are:

* 🥾 Hiking New England as much as I can
* 📝 Blogging with GitHub Pages
* 💻 Mastering and customizing Vim
* ⛩️ Rewatching anime
* ⌨️ Custom mechanical keyboards
* 💬 Fansubbing Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende
* 🆕🎮 Old School RuneScape, Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Stardew Valley

Hi! I'm a second year medical student at the University of Minnesota. I am currently conducting research as a Sarnoff Fellow at the Broad Institute in the [Ellinor Lab](https://www.ellinorlab.org/).

In my free time I enjoy landscape photography, hiking, cycling, and messing around with Arch Linux.

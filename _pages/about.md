Hi! I'm Cody, a second year medical student at the University of Minnesota. I am taking a gap year to conduct research as a Sarnoff Fellow at the Broad Institute. Currently I'm interested in internal medicine and subspecializing in cardiology, but this might change as I enter rotations in third year.

In my free time I enjoy landscape photography, road cycling, Japanese variety shows, and messing around with computers. My current fixes are:

* Hiking New England as much as I can to see all the good views
* Milky Way photography
* Blogging with Jekyll and GitHub Pages
* Banana bread
* Vim

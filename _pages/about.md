Hi! I'm Cody, a second year medical student at the University of Minnesota. I am taking a gap year to conduct research as a Sarnoff Fellow at the Broad Institute in the [Ellinor Lab](https://www.ellinorlab.org/). Currently I'm interested in internal medicine and perhaps cardiology (but this will probably change as I go into rotations :smile:). 

In my free time I enjoy landscape photography, cycling, and messing around with computers.
